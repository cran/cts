Some files in src directory were originally taken from SLICE library (subroutine library in control engineering). It was made available as Fortran source in the public domain. NAG distributed a free version rewritten to their standards but not part of the licensed NAG library for which a fee is paid. Regarding the copyrights of these files, a response from NAG (www.nag.com): "Please simply cite NAG as a source for the material and that you are using it with permission".
