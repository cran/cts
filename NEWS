  o  submitted the package to CRAN 

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-1 (2006-9-29)

  o  In Makevars, replace PKG_LIBS=$(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) with
PKG_LIBS=$(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) 

                Note on `cts' VERSION 1.0-2 (2006-12-11)

  o  This version was used for some calculations with time deformation, not for package development purpose   

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-3 (2010-12-7)

  o  changes from 1.0-1: pass a parameter TRACE in R function to Fortran (TRA), which controls printout. Also minorly improve R functions   

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-4 (2011-7-23)

  o  commented out print/write in Fortran subroutines, and add IMPLICIT NONE

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-5 (2011-8-28)

  o  replace two values computed by calling envron in envirn.f, and remove envron.f. The machine dependent paramaters in envirn.f caused a failure of test/build on Windows machines.

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-6 (2011-10-08)

  o  add Fortran source file diagram
  o  add Fortran source file machine.f to read the machine dependent information written by R function car_control
  0  replace sgefa.f with dgetrf.f, and sgesl.f with dgetrs.f in lycsr.f and mepad.f (sgefa.f and sgesl.f are indeed dgefa.f and dgesl.f, respectively, in Netlib). 
  o  remove unused Fortran source file sgesa.f, sgesl.f, dpodi.f, envron.f, store.f, getmin.f
                
                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-7 (2011-11-16)

  o  modify car.R to generate machine.txt with an extra end line as a workaround for Fortran machine.f failure on Mac machines
                
                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-8 (2011-11-21)

  o  The package failed test/build on Mac machines with version 1.0-6 and 1.0.7. Removed machine.f and used the envirn.f in version 1.0-5, and add getmin.f and store.f in version 1.0-5. 

                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-9 (2011-12-6)

  o  modify plot.spec.ls
  o  change R function names plot.spec.car and plot.spec.ls.
                
                CHANGES in `cts' VERSION 1.0-10 (2012-4-4)
  o  in R function car, to avoid array overrun, change the following lines

     phi <- .Fortran("setupdate",
             phi1=double(order),
 
     to 

     phi <- .Fortran("setupdate",
             phi1=double(order),
